## Cryptid x Polterworx Compatibility Mod

This repository contains the code for the Cryptid x Polterworx Compatibility Mod.

This mod is intended to be used with **Cryptid 0.5.9**.

## What is this?
As Jenwalter666 has discontinued Polterworx, this mod only aims to restore some of the existing functionality of certain jokers, as the original compatibility mod has also been archived. Many players of modded Balatro very much enjoyed Polterworx so this mod hopefully aims to fix some of the bugs between newer versions of Cryptid and Polterworx.

## Notes
This mod is provided on an **as-is basis**. I only made fixes for things that I found during my own gameplay! I do not plan to maintain this. Issues raised on GitHub will be completely ignored. 

You are free to fork this repo and make your own fixes and feel free to raise a pull request back to this repo as well so we can keep fixes in one place!

Please **do not** use this mod to add new content or jokers to PWX, as this is not it's intention. Create your own mod to do so.
